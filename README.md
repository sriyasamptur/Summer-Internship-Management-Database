# Summer-Internship-Management-System

The database application is called UNIVERSITY with the following data requirement. The UNIVERSITY database keeps track of a university’s student, departments and summer internships.

	The university is organized into departments. Each department has a unique name and a number of students under that department. A number of projects can be done under a department each of which has a unique name.

	The database will store information about the student like name, SRN(), gender, department, semester, section, year of graduation, email-id, mobile number and cgpa. A student belonging to a department may work on internships which are specific to a domain during the semester break.

	It is required to keep track of all the projects or internships done during the summer by various students. If the project is done in college then information such as name of the project, number of hours spent, the status of the project, the supervising faculty along with the email-id and mobile number and the domain/club under which this project is done needs to be stored in a database for future reference. If an internship is done outside college then information like the name of the organisation, time period of the internship (number of days) and the domain working under should be recorded.

Storing the above information will make it easier for students to approach the faculty who have done similar projects in the past. It will also make sure that projects done under different clubs of the same university are not repeated. It also gives us an idea on the different organisations that give university students internship during the summer.
